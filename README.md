#### Description:
I made a project in C++ and OOP, the project is an airline ticket booking system, It has two options.
The first is to enter the system as a customer to book one or more reminders, whether they are Round trip or one-way from any country attached to the system.
You can choose where you are on the plane and then print you a ticket with all the details.
The second option is that you enter the system as a manager to find all the customer data booked in the system.

An Airline Reservation System (ARS) is like the digital conductor orchestrating the complex symphony of flight bookings.
Imagine it as the behind-the-scenes maestro ensuring that passengers get their seats, flights take off smoothly, and tickets are issued without a hitch. Here’s the lowdown:

What It Does:
Inventory Management: ARS keeps track of available seats, flight schedules, and fare information for each booking class. It’s like the airline’s memory bank, storing all the essential details.
Reservations: When you call up an airline or book online, ARS handles your reservation requests.
Ticket Issuance: Once you’ve decided on a flight, ARS generates your ticket. It’s the digital equivalent of handing you that precious boarding pass.

Direct vs. Indirect Channels:
Direct Distribution: Airlines use their own reservation systems for direct bookings. So when you call their customer service or visit their website, you’re interacting with their ARS.
Indirect Distribution: Travel agencies and other intermediaries also access the same information through Global Distribution Systems (GDS).

Fun Fact:
Before deregulation, airlines owned their own reservation systems. Travel agents subscribed to these in-house systems. But now, independent companies run the GDS, and airlines and travel agencies are their major subscribers.
Beyond Air Travel:
The messaging standards used by ARS are global and apply to more than just air transportation. They’re like the secret language that airlines and GDS platforms use to communicate.

Anyone can download source code to try the program through this link >> {}

Future development plans aim to make this program linked to a database and develop the user interface and make the program faster or more efficient.
It is possible to create such a program in some other languages ​​such as Python or Java.
It can also be converted into a web application or a desktop application.
